              <i>A long time ago</i>, lots of events were happening in a galaxy
              far far away.
            </div>
            <div>
              Those events required an <b>active support force</b>, ready to act
              against whatever issue or request an event and its clients would
              encounter during its unrolling.
            </div>
            <div>
              There were managers, which had to assign and manage this work
              force. Their job was to keep track of those events, while keeping
              the work force aligned and split in shifts.
            </div>
            <div>
              <b

            </div>
            <hr />
            <div>
              <b>BUT</b> those events had the bad idea of changing their dates,
              their times, their details...
            </div>
            <div>
              and the managers had to check constantly them, to manually search
              for their hidden and crucial changes, to manually update their old
              and rusty
              <span class="d-inline-block fw-bold">

          <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
          <div>
            Between 2018 and 2020, I worked as a web support on live events
            coverage. We were a team of around <b>12 people</b> and we only had
            a manager.
          </div>
          <div>
            My boss had to spend a lot of time on our shifts organization. His
            activities were:
            <ul>
              <li>checking if any new events were scheduled</li>
              <li>checking if those actually required a staff coverage</li>
              <li>
                manually reviewing already existing events, to search for any
                updates that required a shift update or a shift delete
              </li>
              <li>keeping staff updated on their shifts and their timings</li>
              <li>retrieving their availability</li>
              <li>collecting each staff answer for each assignations</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            All of his job was done with only the help of an Excel sheet, mails
            and auto-managed private messagging chats, and... the events
            json-xml endpoints exposed by each project he managed.
          </div>
          <div>
            It was really strange to see someone in 202X still going full-manual
            on such
            <span class="fw-bold fw-italic">time-consuming tasks </span>, like
            keeping track of hundreds of events with no tool or automation
            system.
          </div>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <div>
            When I became a dev in the same company I was a support, one of the
            first goals I was given was to create a potential new company tool.
          </div>
          <div>
            When I was collecting ideas for the tool, my old manager
            <a

              >@Nicholas
            </a>
            came by and splurted out the idea:
            <div class="alert alert-success p-1 w-75 fw-italic fw-bold">
              "why don't we create a tool to manage shifts and staff? You know
              what the staff need, I know what the managers need, mix 'em up and
              we're good to go!"

          <h3 id="mission">The mission</h3>
          <div>
            We had a clear mission ahead of us:
            <span class="alert alert-primary fw-bold p-1">
              we wanted to create a small system that could help a manager
              manage his workforce while leaving most of the "boilerplate work"
              to automatic procedures.
            </span>
          </div>
          <div>
            <i>Boilerplate work</i> is everything that doesn't require a
            managerial choice at its base.
          </div>
          <div>
            Examples? Checking an event endpoint and searching for any event
            update. Creating a shift entity from the list of existing event. We
            wanted to leverage these annoyances to leave to the managers only
            the burden of assigning the staff...
          </div>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <div>
            Me and
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-de-pasquale-9a3b11178"
              >@Nicholas
            </a>
            worked hard for more than a year to create this system. We defined
            some requirements beforehand:
            <ul>
              <li>
                staff should be assigned to shifts freely by the manager: he
                would have been able to decide their start date, their end,
                their role and so on, without any particular constraint set from
                the tool;
              </li>
              <li>
                events should heavily rely on import automatization; the tool
                should use endpoints and data provided by the client to create
                and retrieve events without manual requirements;
              </li>
              <li>
                managers shouldn't need to create a shift because shifts should
                be created from the tool based on the events received; this
                would have meant to invert the usual flow! You don't bother
                anymore on shifts, you only insert/import the events and shifts
                will be automatically prepared from these.
              </li>
              <li>
                shifts should group together events with the same start day and
                the same assignations rule (an info that the manager defines to
                identitfy the coverage level behind an event);
              </li>
              <li>
                manager should have easy access to exported data, to get an
                helpful hand when doing budget plannings and cost review.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="divider"></div>
          </div>
          <div>
            All this combined went to become part of the first beta version;
            after that time, many other went by, many changes and improvements
            were done until recently, when we reached the
            <b>first major release</b>.
          </div>
          <div>
            In these months we never stopped visualizing new chances to improve
            the requirements. As of today, we added loads more - let me give
            some examples:
            <ul>
              <li>
                the chance to assign a member to a selection of events from its
                shift
              </li>
              <li>the location where the staff member will work</li>
              <li>
                the freedom for the staff member to insert the actual shift
                timings he performed
              </li>
              <li>
                easy events manipulation UI, to give complete freedom to the
                manager to use automatization or support exceptional needs
              </li>
              <li>
                different dashboards for data visualization (shift view, staff
                comparison, excel-style view...)
              </li>
              <li>
                calendar export service, for an easier integration with an
                external calendar
              </li>
            </ul>
            The job never stops and many other will come in the near future.
            Spoiler: right now, we're working on the main v2 feature: automatic
            import setup that can be dynamically created from the UI. It will be
            difficult to develop but it will be big when dropped; it will be
            quite a powerful improvement!
