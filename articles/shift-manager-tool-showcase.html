        <h1>Shift Manager Tool: a showcase</h1>
        <h2>There was a time...</h2>
        <section id="intro">
          <div>
            A long time ago, there were lots of events happening in a galaxy far
            far away. Those events required a working support force, ready to
            act against whatever issue or need the event would encounter during
            its svolgimento.
            There were managers, which had to assign and manage this work force.
            Their job was to keep track of those events while keeping the work
            force aligned and split in shifts.
            If the story were to end here, we wouldn't have a story at all. But
            those events had the bad idea of changing their dates and times...
            and so the managers constantly had to check events, to manually
            search for changes, to manually update their old and rusty
            Sacred-Excel-Staff-Tables while notifying their staff...
            Those were hard and dark times, until...
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <div>Between 2018 and 2020, I worked as a web support on live events
            coverage. We were a team of around 12 people and we only had a
            manager.
            This man had to spend a lot of time on our shifts organization. He
            had to check if any new events were scheduled and required coverage,
            he had to manually review the events data to search for any updates
            that required a shift update or a shift delete, he had to keep us
            updated on our shifts, our timings, he had to retrieve our
            availability and then to collect from us our answer to his
            assignations.
            All of his job was done with the help of an Excel Table, mails
            and... the events collections. It was strange to see someone in 202X
            still going full-manual on such time-consuming tasks, like keeping
            track of hundreds of events with no tool or automation system.

            When I was hired as a dev for the same company I worked as a
            support, in my first period, one of the first goals I was given was
            that of creating an internal company tool. When I was collecting
            ideas for the tool, my old manager @Nicholas came by and splurted
            out the idea: why don't we create a tool to manage shifts and staff?
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>The mission</h3>
          <div>We had a clear mission ahead of us: we wanted to create a small
            system that could help a manager manage his workforce while leaving
            most of the "boilerplate work" to automatic procedures.
            Boilerplate work was everything that didn't require a managerial
            choice at its base. Examples? Checking an event endpoint and
            searchinf for any event update. Creating a shift placeholder from
            the list of existing events, leaving to the managers only the burden
            of assigning the staff...

            Me and @Nicholas worked hard for more than a year to create this
            system.
            We defined some requirements beforehand:
            - staff should be assigned to shifts freely by the manager: he would
            have been able to decide their start date, their end, their role and
            so on, without any particular constraint set from the tool
            - events should heavily rely on import automatization; the tool
            should use endpoints and data provided by the client to create and
            retrieve events without manual requirements
            - managers shouldn't need to create a shift because shifts should be
            created from the tool based on the events received; this would have
            meant to invert the usual flow! You don't bother anymore on shifts,
            you only insert/import the events and shifts will be automatically
            prepared from these.
            - shifts should group together events with the same start day and
            the same assignations rule (an info that the manager defines to
            identitfy the coverage level behind an event)
            - manager should have easy access to exported data, to get an
            helpful hand when doing budget plannings and cost review.

            All this combined went to become part of the first alpha version;
            after that time, many versions went by, many changes and
            improvements were done until recently, when we reached the first
            major version.
            We added many things with time; a small list:
            - [...]
            - staff can be assigned to locations
            - candidatures from staff members to existing events!
          </div>

          <h3>Let'see some action!</h3>
          <div>Let me show you some juice on the tool potentialities, it will be
            way more interesting than other words!
            <ol>
              <li>
                <include src="articles/parts/smt-carousels.html"></include>
                1. Check and perform some staff assignments
                img-a: (dashboard with displayed shifts) select projects and
                period
                and check your shifts scheduler
                img-b: (shift modal - empty) click a shift and check its
                complete
                data: events, shift rule and associated info, candidates, shift
                informations, the assignment lists
                img-c: (candidates view) check "candidature" and drag&drop a
                candidate onto one of your assignment, to fill the data based on
                the
                member
                img-d: (shift modal - some assignments) choose for each
                assignment
                the role, the associated events, the location, start and end
                time,
                all day flag to automatically take entire days
                </lu>
                2. Check and compare staff workload
                img-a: (dashboard with 3 memmbers compared) select and compare
                staff
                members load to easily understand every team member status and
                improve shift equality
                3. Staff view
                img-a: (staff modal) a staff member will read its shift
                information,
                he will receive personal mails to notify him on new shifts or on
                any
                change
                4. Imports
                img-a: (import options) use the automatic import based on your
                project endpoints to perform a massive automatic import; every
                day
                the import will be run in the background, to let you keep your
                project aligned on its events without any manual intervention
                img-b: (manual import) use the manual event creation to add,
                insert,
                delete any extra-events not mapped in any available endpoint; if
                you
                don't have endpoints or you want complete freedom on your events
                management, you can use it as much as you like to manually
                manage
                events!
                5. Exports
                img-a: (export options): choose between the following exports:
                [...] and remind that many more can be easily implemented by
                extending the existing api!
                img-b: (export option example) use the export and select the
                input
                data to produce custom extractions tailored on your requirements
            </ol>

            I won't go on with the examples, otherwise I wouldn't arouse your
            curiosity enough :)

          <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
          <div>- built on top of ASP .NET Core backend, on 3 separate projects -
            1 for the OAuth2.0 server, 1 hosting the API Server, 1 for the
            client app
            - MongoDB is the application database, accessible only through the
            exposed Api Layer
            - Api project uses Serilog as logging system, Hangfire to manage
            background jobs (mainly to implement a reliable mail system,
            enterprise-safe), ElmahCore to catch and log any unhandled exception
            - Client application is made with React + Redux (while being hosted
            on top of the ASP .NET Core MVC project)
            [package.json list to read]
            - Infrastructure is hosted on Docker containers, exposed through a
            Kubernetes cluster
            - CI/CD Pipelines are hosted on Azure Devops repository
