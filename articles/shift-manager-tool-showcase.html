Their job was to keep track of those events, while keeping the work force aligned and split in shifts. </div> <div> <b>If the story were to end here, we wouldn't have a story at all.</b> </div> <hr> <div> <b>BUT</b> those events had the bad idea of changing their dates, their times, their details... </div> <div> and the managers had to check constantly them, to manually search for their hidden and crucial changes, to manually update their old and rusty <span class="d-inline-block fw-bold"> Tables of the Holy Excel Staff Shifts Law </span> while making sure that all their staff are notified and aligned on the shift updates... </div> <div class="alert alert-success fw-bold p-0"> Those were hard and dark times, until... </div> </div> </section> <section> <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3> <div> Between 2018 and 2020, I worked as a web support on live events coverage. We were a team of around <b>12 people</b> and we only had a manager. </div> <div> My boss had to spend a lot of time on our shifts organization. His activities were: <ul> <li>checking if any new events were scheduled</li> <li>checking if those actually required a staff coverage</li> <li> manually reviewing already existing events, to search for any updates that required a shift update or a shift delete </li> <li>keeping staff updated on their shifts and their timings</li> <li>retrieving their availability</li> <li>collecting each staff answer for each assignations</li> </ul> </div> <div> All of his job was done with only the help of an Excel sheet, mails and auto-managed private messagging chats, and... the events json-xml endpoints exposed by each project he managed. </div> <div> It was really strange to see someone in 202X still going full-manual on such <span class="fw-bold fw-italic">time-consuming tasks </span>, like keeping track of hundreds of events with no tool or automation system. </div> <div class="divider"></div> <div> When I became a dev in the same company I was a support, one of the first goals I was given was to create a potential new company tool. </div> <div> When I was collecting ideas for the tool, my old manager <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-de-pasquale-9a3b11178">@Nicholas </a> came by and splurted out the idea: <div class="alert alert-success fw-bold fw-italic p-1 w-75"> "why don't we create a tool to manage shifts and staff? You know what the staff need, I know what the managers need, mix 'em up and we're good to go!" </div> </div> </section> <section> <h3 id="mission">The mission</h3> <div> We had a clear mission ahead of us: <span class="alert alert-primary fw-bold p-1"> we wanted to create a small system that could help a manager manage his workforce while leaving most of the "boilerplate work" to automatic procedures. </span> </div> <div> <i>Boilerplate work</i> is everything that doesn't require a managerial choice at its base. </div> <div> Examples? Checking an event endpoint and searching for any event update. Creating a shift entity from the list of existing event. We wanted to leverage these annoyances to leave to the managers only the burden of assigning the staff... </div> <div class="divider"></div> <div> Me and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-de-pasquale-9a3b11178">@Nicholas </a> worked hard for more than a year to create this system. We defined some requirements beforehand: <ul> <li> staff should be assigned to shifts freely by the manager: he would have been able to decide their start date, their end, their role and so on, without any particular constraint set from the tool; </li> <li> events should heavily rely on import automatization; the tool should use endpoints and data provided by the client to create and retrieve events without manual requirements; </li> <li> managers shouldn't need to create a shift because shifts should be created from the tool based on the events received; this would have meant to invert the usual flow! You don't bother anymore on shifts, you only insert/import the events and shifts will be automatically prepared from these. </li> <li> shifts should group together events with the same start day and the same assignations rule (an info that the manager defines to identitfy the coverage level behind an event); </li> <li> manager should have easy access to exported data, to get an helpful hand when doing budget plannings and cost review. </li> </ul> <div class="divider"></div> </div> <div> All this combined went to become part of the first beta version; after that time, many other went by, many changes and improvements were done until recently, when we reached the <b>first major release</b>. </div> <div> In these months we never stopped visualizing new chances to improve the requirements. As of today, we added loads more - let me give some examples: <ul> <li> the chance to assign a member to a selection of events from its shift </li> <li>the location where the staff member will work</li> <li> the freedom for the staff member to insert the actual shift timings he performed </li> <li> easy events manipulation UI, to give complete freedom to the manager to use automatization or support exceptional needs </li> <li> different dashboards for data visualization (shift view, staff comparison, excel-style view...) </li> <li> calendar export service, for an easier integration with an external calendar </li> </ul> The job never stops and many other will come in the near future. Spoiler: right now, we're working on the main v2 feature: automatic import setup that can be dynamically created from the UI. It will be difficult to develop but it will be big when dropped; it will be quite a powerful improvement! </div> </section> <section> <h3 id="showcase">Let'see some action!</h3> <div> Let me show you some juice on the tool potentialities, it will be way more interesting than other words! <small class="d-block"> (Hover or click onto the images to read the captions) </small> </div> <div class="fs-5 text-center"> <ol> <li>Check and perform shift assignments</li> <div class="swiper-external-container"> <div class="swiper-container"> <div class="swiper"> <div class="gallery gallery-sh-ass swiper-wrapper"> <div class="swiper-slide"> <div class="card-image"> <a data-caption="Select projects and time period, then check your shifts schedule" data-gallery="gallery-demo-sh-ass" href="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh1.e847ede0.png"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh1.e847ede0.png" title="Select projects and time period, then check your shifts schedule" "=""> </a> <div class="swiper-caption">Select projects and time period, then check your shifts schedule</div> </div> </div> <div class="swiper-slide"> <div class="card-image"> <a data-caption="Click a shift and check its complete data: events, shift rule and associated info, candidates, shift informations, the assignment lists" data-gallery="gallery-demo-sh-ass" href="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh2.ca08746b.png"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh2.ca08746b.png" title="Click a shift and check its complete data: events, shift rule and associated info, candidates, shift informations, the assignment lists" "=""> </a> <div class="swiper-caption">Click a shift and check its complete data: events, shift rule and associated info, candidates, shift informations, the assignment lists</div> </div> </div> <div class="swiper-slide"> <div class="card-image"> <a data-caption="Check candidatures and drag&amp;drop a candidate onto one of your assignment, to fill the data based on that staff member" data-gallery="gallery-demo-sh-ass" href="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh3.fa6204a3.png"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh3.fa6204a3.png" title="Check candidatures and drag&amp;drop a candidate onto one of your assignment, to fill the data based on that staff member" "=""> </a> <div class="swiper-caption">Check candidatures and drag&amp;drop a candidate onto one of your assignment, to fill the data based on that staff member</div> </div> </div> <div class="swiper-slide"> <div class="card-image"> <a data-caption="Choose for each assignment the role, the associated events, the location, start and end time..." data-gallery="gallery-demo-sh-ass" href="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh4.c43a43d4.png"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/db-sh4.c43a43d4.png" title="Choose for each assignment the role, the associated events, the location, start and end time..."
