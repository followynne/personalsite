            <div>
              <i>A long time ago</i>, lots of events were happening in a galaxy
              far far away.
            </div>
            <div>
              Those events required an <b>active support force</b>, ready to act
              against whatever issue or request an event and its clients would
              encounter during its unrolling.
            </div>
            <div>
              There were managers, which had to assign and manage this work
              force. Their job was to keep track of those events, while keeping
              the work force aligned and split in shifts.
            </div>
            <div>
              <b
                >If the story were to end here, we wouldn't have a story at
                all.</b
              >
            </div>
            <hr />
            <div>
              <b>BUT</b> those events had the bad idea of changing their dates,
              their times, their details...
            </div>
            <div>
              and the managers had to check constantly them, to manually search
              for their hidden and crucial changes, to manually update their old
              and rusty
              <span class="d-inline-block fw-bold">
                Tables of the Holy Excel Staff Shifts Law
              </span>
              while making sure that all their staff are notified and aligned on
              the shift updates...
            </div>
            <div class="alert alert-success fw-bold p-0">
              Those were hard and dark times, until...

          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <div>
            Between 2018 and 2020, I worked as a web support on live events
            coverage. We were a team of around <b>12 people</b> and we only had
            a manager.
          </div>
          <div>
            My boss had to spend a lot of time on our shifts organization. His
            activities were:
            <ul>
              <li>checking if any new events were scheduled</li>
              <li>checking if those actually required a staff coverage</li>
              <li>
                manually reviewing already existing events, to search for any
                updates that required a shift update or a shift delete
              </li>
              <li>keeping staff updated on their shifts and their timings</li>
              <li>retrieving their availability</li>
              <li>collecting each staff answer for each assignations</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            All of his job was done with only the help of an Excel sheet, mails
            and auto-managed private messagging chats, and... the events
            json-xml endpoints exposed by each project he managed.
          </div>
          <div>
            It was really strange to see someone in 202X still going full-manual
            on such
            <span class="fw-bold fw-italic">time-consuming tasks </span>, like
            keeping track of hundreds of events with no tool or automation
            system.
          </div>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <div>
            When I became a dev in the same company I was a support, one of the
            first goals I was given was to create a potential new company tool.
          </div>
          <div>
            When I was collecting ideas for the tool, my old manager
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-de-pasquale-9a3b11178"
              >@Nicholas
            </a>
            came by and splurted out the idea:
            <div class="alert alert-success w-75 fw-italic fw-bold">
              "why don't we create a tool to manage shifts and staff? You know
              what the staff need, I know what the managers need, mix 'em up and
              we're good to go!"
            </div>

          <h3>The mission</h3>
          <div>
            We had a clear mission ahead of us: we wanted to create a small
            system that could help a manager manage his workforce while leaving
            most of the "boilerplate work" to automatic procedures. Boilerplate
            work was everything that didn't require a managerial choice at its
            base. Examples? Checking an event endpoint and searchinf for any
            event update. Creating a shift placeholder from the list of existing
            events, leaving to the managers only the burden of assigning the
            staff... Me and @Nicholas worked hard for more than a year to create
            this system. We defined some requirements beforehand: - staff should
            be assigned to shifts freely by the manager: he would have been able
            to decide their start date, their end, their role and so on, without
            any particular constraint set from the tool - events should heavily
            rely on import automatization; the tool should use endpoints and
            data provided by the client to create and retrieve events without
            manual requirements - managers shouldn't need to create a shift
            because shifts should be created from the tool based on the events
            received; this would have meant to invert the usual flow! You don't
            bother anymore on shifts, you only insert/import the events and
            shifts will be automatically prepared from these. - shifts should
            group together events with the same start day and the same
            assignations rule (an info that the manager defines to identitfy the
            coverage level behind an event) - manager should have easy access to
            exported data, to get an helpful hand when doing budget plannings
            and cost review. All this combined went to become part of the first
            alpha version; after that time, many versions went by, many changes
            and improvements were done until recently, when we reached the first
            major version. We added many things with time; a small list: - [...]
            - staff can be assigned to locations - candidatures from staff
            members to existing events!

            - built on top of ASP .NET Core backend, on 3 separate projects - 1
            for the OAuth2.0 server, 1 hosting the API Server, 1 for the client
            app - MongoDB is the application database, accessible only through
            the exposed Api Layer - Api project uses Serilog as logging system,
            Hangfire to manage background jobs (mainly to implement a reliable
            mail system, enterprise-safe), ElmahCore to catch and log any
            unhandled exception - Client application is made with React + Redux
            (while being hosted on top of the ASP .NET Core MVC project)
            [package.json list to read] - Infrastructure is hosted on Docker
            containers, exposed through a Kubernetes cluster - CI/CD Pipelines
            are hosted on Azure Devops repository
