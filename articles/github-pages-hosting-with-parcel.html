If you are here, you want to deploy & publish a site using the free hosting offered by <a href="https://www.github.com">Github </a> and <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>, the latter as the bundler for all the packages/libraries you use in your site ðŸ˜Š</h2> <section id="intro"> <div>If you're a beginner (as I were some months ago), you may be questioning, why do I need an hosting service and a bundler? Let me answer in the quickest & simplest way I can (click <a href="#guide">Here</a> to go straight to the point instead).<br> <b>An hosting service is a service that will actually <i>hosts</i> all the files of your site and expose them for public access.</b> Without this service, you would need to expose those files constantly to the world from your laptop! When you start messing around, it's very nice to have a free and good hosting service that you can use directly from your repository - that's where <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> comes in handy.<br> <b>A bundler is a tool that helps to bundle modules (libraries, a.k.a. reusables pieces of code) you use in your application in files ready to be included in your web pages and to be read by browsers.</b> Many bundlers exist for Javascript but Parcel has the great strength of being really <b>straight-forward and simple</b> to use! At the start of a web development career, you'll want to use libraries, frameworks, without additional overhead for their usage.<br>Bundlers like Webpack have a steep learning curve, due to its great customization options, and aren't really the best option for newcomers or small sites. Parcel, on the other hand, is simple to use and really good to start working on your skills! </div> <div class="alert alert-warning width-reduce"><i><b>Note</b>: When you feel ready, you can start reading more on bundlers from this great source: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Package_management"> MDN Package Management</a>! Don't rush it, as it's quite an intermediate topic, but keep in mind to give it a look, it's an important topic to know.<span class="title">In-depth Corner</span></i> </div> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" class="bold">WYSIWYG</a>: you're about to read a <span class="bold">simple guide</span> that uses Parcel to bundle all those libraries and deploy the built pages on the <span class="bold italic">gh-pages branch</span> branch of your Github repo, ready for the world to read it.<br> </section> <section id="requirements"> <h3>Requirements</h3> <div>For this tutorial, you'll need to have: <ul> <li>a Github account (<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Hello World on Github)</a></li> <li><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Nodejs & npm (the Javascript package manager we'll use to install libraries and use parcel)</a></li> <li> <a href="https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html">Parcel</a> </li> </ul> Follow the links if you need help on those ones.<br> <div class="text-bold">At <a strong href="https://github.com/followynne/github-pages-hosting-with-parcel" target="_blank">this page</a> you can find the code of a basic site that was created with this tutorial. You can check it live at <a href="https://followynne.github.io/github-pages-hosting-with-parcel/" target="_blank">Live Example</a>!</div> <div class="alert alert-info width-reduce">A note: <span class="text- text-bold">$</span> identifies code lines in a Shell/Terminal - when you paste the code lines in the shell, leave out the starting $.<br> You'll find all the instructions and commands inside a <code>code</code> section!<span class="title">In-depth Corner</span> </div> </div> </section> <section id="guide"> <h3>Guide</h3> <div>Okay, let's start assuming you have created your Hello World Site. You've created all the folders for your files, you've got your nice index.html ready and working, with the stylesheets and scripts correctly referenced inside.<br> You uploaded it on GitHub and it looks neat.<br> Let's assume you now want to use Bootstrap and JQuery without using a CDN, therefore you'll use a package manager and will create a bundle for your files and libraries ðŸ˜Š.</div> <ol> <li> <div>Install Node.js (that comes with npm) and then proceed to <b>install the libraries</b> you need from the terminal: </div> <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>$ cd "your_folder_path"
$ npm init
$ npm i parcel
$ npm i bootstrap
$ npm i popper.js
$ npm i jquery</code>
</pre> <div class="alert alert-warning width-reduce">As you can see, at line 3 I made you install Parcel. You can also install it as a global package by typing <code class="text-bold">$ npm i parcel -g</code> instead.<br>If you choose to install it globally, you'll be able to use it on different projects without needing to reinstall it each time. In this case, it's recommended to include parcel as a <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/npm-peer-dependencies/" target="_blank">peer-dependency</a> in your package.json.<span class="title">In-depth Corner</span> </div> </li> <li> With <code>npm init</code> you create a package.json by filling the input provided. <b>Add the following lines to your package.json</b>: <pre>
<code>"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel ./*.html",
    "predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build ./*.html --public-url "paste here your ENTIRE REPO URL, comprehensive of http/https part"",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
},</code></pre> <b>scripts</b> is a JSON property of package.json where you can write shell commands and reference them with aliases from npm. Aliases are way easier to use and remember than the entire commands you'll use. You'll call them by writing <code>npm run {script_key}</code>. We'll understand in a second what these lines mean. </li> <li>At the start of your Javascript entry point you require the libraries: <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>// index.js
import $ from 'jquery'
import 'popper.js'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap'</code></pre> and then, in the same .js file you write a simple function to test that the import works: <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>// index.js
$(document).ready(()=>{
    $('body').html('Hello World, if you see this message Parcel Bundler and Github Hosting are working nicely!');
})</code></pre> You can now run Parcel with <code>$ npm run start</code> and magic, something happens! <div>Parcel will build and host your files on a local port, thus you'll now be able to browse your site at <i>localhost:{port}</i> (replace port with the one you can read in the terminal). When you open the page you'll find that your site is working! </div> <div class="alert alert-info width-reduce"><span class="text-bold">npm run start</span> is the first alias we use, when we call it it will simply run parcel with an argument relative to the entry points of the application.<br> <i>./*.html</i> is a glob pattern with a wildcard that stands for: build all the .html extension files you find in the folder from where you run the command. If you have html in sub-folders, you can add other globs to the command like ./{folder}/*.html (Parcel will interpret it as a list of entries to search). <span class="title">In-depth Corner</span> </div> We have our site running fine with all the built libraries and now we want to publish it using Github-Pages Hosting. </li> <li>First thing, in the <i>.gitignore</i> let's add those lines: <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>// we will ignore node_modules, dist (the output folder you won't track) and the .cache (parcel working folder) 
node_modules/
dist
.cache</code></pre> We then install a new package from npm that will take care of pushing the built code to the gh-pages branch on your remote repository: <pre lang="no-highlight"><code>$ npm install gh-pages</code></pre> Let's create a Github-Pages branch, push to your remote repo and the switch back: <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>$ git branch gh-pages
$ git checkout gh-pages
$ git push origin gh-pages
$ git checkout master
</code></pre> </li> <li>We're back on the main branch, with our gh-pages running (you can check that the page is online in your online repo, by going to Settings. Github should publish it by default when it finds the gh-pages branch. If you need further help check <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">the documentation</a>).<br> It's now time to review the other two lines of the "scripts" section we added before. <div class="alert alert-info width-reduce"><span class="title">In-depth Corner</span>What are we doing? We are creating a script for npm that will execute those commands: <div><b>Pre-Deploy</b>: it will delete the previous dist folder (the folder where are located the processed parcel files) + it will build the site from your entry point. With public-url you set the dns name of your site.</div> <div><b>Deploy</b>: it will use gh-pages package to re-create the gh-pages branch based on the dist folder and it will "commit&push" it to your remote repo.</div> </div> <div class="alert alert-danger width-reduce"><b><span class="title-warning">WARNING!</span>Please Note: if you have a CNAME file, containing the personalized url of your site, you !MUST! substitute the "predeploy" line in the last snippet with:</b> <pre lang="no-highlight"><code>"predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url "paste here your PERSONAL url, comprehensive of http/https part" && cp CNAME ./dist"</code></pre> This instruction will make Parcel build your page on the specified url and it will copy the CPNAME file in the dist folder - this way you'll be able to presist the CNAME and map the custom domain you're using. <br>You can apply the same command for every file you need to include in your hosted files. </div> </li> <li>The job is now easy: you work on your site by running <code>npm run start</code> script, that use the Parcel local dev server. <div>Every time you have a new version ready to deploy, you type this command in Terminal: <pre lang="no-highlight"><code>$ npm run deploy</code></pre> Parcel will run, build the site and deploy it to GitHub with all the dependencies you used and are needed by your scripts. Fast, easy, good to go! </div> </li> </ol> </section> <section id="greetings"> <h3>Thanks for reading!</h3> <div>This small guide is a simple start point for your site. I felt interesting to write it because it helps a newcomer to start messing around with web development and, at the same time, I cited and wrote some concepts that a new dev will read as an appetizer, hopefully giving him the curiosity to search more!
