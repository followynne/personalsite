              Hi! I'm <span class="bold">Matteo</span>.

            <p>
              I'm a <span class="bold">Web & Software Developer</span> currently
              working for Deltatre, from their Turin offices. Nowadays I work
              both on the back-end and front-end services, thus I could consider
              myself a full-stack dev... JK, not nearly good enough to be decent
              on neither one of them. üò¨ I graduated from the

              The languages I use are <br />
              <span class="bold">.Net/C#</span>,
              <span class="bold">Typescript & React</span>,<br />
              with C# being the language I'm mastering as my "main". From a Dbs
              perspective, I use daily
              <span class="bold">SQL lang. on SQL Server specs</span> and
              <span class="bold">MongoDb</span> on the No-SQL side. To add to
              the mix of what I always use, there's
              <span class="bold">Git</span> (of course), Azure DevOps & Github
              for source control management.

              Would I like to work with other langs? Sure I would! I'd be happy
              to study and work with <span class="fw-bold"> Rust & Go</span>. On
              the other side, I refuse to work with
              <span class="fw-bold"> PHP and Java</span>.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="text-white">
              Why? I'm not a jack-of-all-trades fan. I love to learn and master,
              better than knowing something of everything. Rust or Go would be
              domains that help me learn and challenge myself on new concepts,
              different perspectives, low-level topics I didn't study
              previously. I love to learn, as already said. PHP or Java, on the
              other side... are C#-like. I like C# more and I prefer to master
              it, instead of using them all without choosing my bestie. If
              someone needs PHP, I think it's best to actually hire a PHP dev
              than making me mock one.
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p>
              I love programming and I want to grow and learn as much as I can
              as a developer. I'm trying to learn more about Design Patterns and
              Software Architecture, to improve my capabilities of creating
              good, clean, better code. For the same reason, I want to learn and
              improve over TDD, as I use it but I'd like to become better at it.

              Other than these, I unfortunately daily use CSS & Sass - but
              please ignore this information, the tech thing I utterly hate the
              most is Css and everything concerning it. If you want me to mostly
              work on Css-things, well, you're messing with the wrong guy mate.
              üò§ I used some <span class="bold">Docker e Kubernetes</span> but
              I'm still a near newbie (they're a quite complex new world to
              approach).

              In a past life, I was an art historian (well, not really - I just
              have a Master's degree in Art History). I also worked as a
              freelance translator during my master's degree - if you're
              interested, you can find more in my CV while in my portfolio
              you'll find a link to my thesis.

              Since I was a little kid I've been an eager reader, both books and
              comics; I'm a heavy video gamer since PSX, gone through the
              ps2/3/4 era always with a gamepad (or a Nintendo DS) in hand; I
              know about football, without being a fan as I were in my youth.

              To better understand my soul and my personality, the thing that
