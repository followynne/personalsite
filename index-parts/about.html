I work both on the back-end and front-end services and I consider myself a full-stack dev. I graduated from <a href="http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/courses/backend-development/" target="blank">Integrated Backend Services</a> course, hosted by <a href="http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/" target="blank">ITS ICT - Turin</a>, where I started to dig into development. </p> </div> <div class="align-content-center col-12 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xl-4 lh-small order-md-3 text-center text-white"> <ul class="text-white" style="list-style:none"> <li class="fw-bold">My stack</li> <li>C# and .NET Core</li> <li>Typescript & React</li> <li>Docker</li> <li>MongoDb</li> <li>Git</li> <li>Azure DevOps & Github</li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-12 lh-small order-4 pt-2"> <p class="text-white"> Would I like to work with other langs? Sure I would! I'd be happy to study and work with <span class="fw-bold"> Rust & Go</span> while I wouldn't be keen to work with <span class="fw-bold"> PHP and Java</span>. </p> <p class="text-white"> Why? I'm not a jack-of-all-trades fan. I love to learn and master, better than knowing something of everything. Rust or Go would be domains that help me learn and challenge myself on new concepts, different perspectives, low-level topics I didn't study previously. I love to learn, as already said. PHP or Java, on the other side... are C#-like. I like C# more and I prefer to master it, instead of using them all without choosing my bestie. If someone needs PHP, I think it's best to actually hire a PHP dev than making me mock one. </p> <p> I love programming and I want to grow and learn as much as I can as a developer. I'm trying to learn more about Design Patterns and Software Architecture, to improve my capabilities of creating good, clean, better code. For the same reason, I want to learn and improve over TDD, as I use it but I'd like to become better at it. </p> <p> Oh, don't forget - the tech thing I hate the most is CSS and everything concerning. If you want me to mostly work on Css-things - well, you're messing with the wrong guy mate. ðŸ˜¤ </p> <h4>Other than...</h4> <p> In a past life, I was an art historian (well, not really - I just have a Master's degree in Art History). I also worked as a freelance translator during my master's degree - if you're interested, you can find more in my CV while in my portfolio you'll find a link to my thesis. </p> <p> I'm a film passionate and I go the cinema everytime I can. Since I was a little kid I've been an eager reader, both books and comics; I'm a heavy video gamer since PSX, gone through the PS2/3/4 era always with a gamepad (or a Nintendo DS) in hand. In the past years I became passionate about climbing, padel and yoga and I practice them every week. </p> <p> To better understand my soul and my personality, the thing that embodies me the most is the <span class="bold">atmosphere you deeply breathe, to the bottom of your lungs, when you walk in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSRIlwXDBB4" target="blank">Ico</a></span> classic videogame - 'nuff said. If you're one like me, you'll have already understood. </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <a href="https://unsplash.com/it/@hngstrm" class="img-attrib mb-1 mt-1 text-white">pic by Henry & Co.</a> </div> </div>
