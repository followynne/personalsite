            <h4>Hi! I'm <span class="bold">Matteo</span>. </h4>
            <p>I'm a <span class="bold">Web Developer</span> currently
              working for Deltatre, from their Turin offices. Nowadays I
              work both on back-end and front-end services, thus I could
              consider myself a full-stack dev... JK, not nearly good enough
              to be decent on neither one of them. üò¨ I graduated from the
              <a href="http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/courses/backend-development/"
                target="blank">Integrated Backend Services</a> course,
              hosted by <a href="http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/"
                target="blank">ITS ICT - Turin</a>, where I started to dig
              into development.
            </p>
            <h4>Let's get down to the real business - Programming üòè</h4>
            <p>The languages I currently use are <span
                class="bold">.Net/C#</span>, <span class="bold">Javascript &
                React</span>, the first being the language I'm trying to
              master as my "main". From a Dbs perspective, I use on a daily
              basis <span class="bold">SQL lang. on SQL Server specs</span>
              while I frequently have to interact with <span
                class="bold">MongoDb</span> operations. To add to the mix of
              what I always use, there's <span class="bold">Git</span> (of
              course), Azure Devops & Github for the source control
              management. </p>
            <p>As of the start of 2021, on my Learning todo I have .Net (to
              improve and master the best I can) and Typescript. On a higher
              pov, I'm trying to learn more on Design Patterns and Software
              Architecture, to improve my capabilities of creating good,
              clean, better code. For the same reason I want to learn and
              improve over TDD, as I use it but I'd like to become better at
              it. </p>
            <p>Other than these, I unfortunately daily use Css & Sass - but
              please ignore this information, the tech thing I utterly hate
              the most is Css and everything concerning it. If you want me
              to mostly work on Css-things, well, you're messing with the
              wrong guy mate. üò§ I used some <span class="bold">Docker e
                Kubernetes</span> but I'm still a nearly newbie (they're a
              quite complex new world to approach). </p>
            <h4>Other than...</h4>
            <p> In a past life I was an art historian (well, not really - I
              just have a Master's degree in Art History). I also worked as
              a freelance translator during my master's degree - if you're
              interested, you can find more in my CV while in my portfolio I
              put a link to my thesis. </p>
            <p>Since I was a little kid I've been an eager reader, both
              books and comics; I'm a heavy videogamer since psX, gone
              throught the ps2/3/4 era always with a gamepad (or a Nintendo
              DS) in hand; I know about football, without being a fan as I
              were in my youth.</p>
            <p>To better understand my soul and my personality, the thing
              that embodies myself the most is the <span class="bold">atmosphere
                you deeply breath, to the bottom of
                your lungs, when you walk in <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSRIlwXDBB4"

              said. If you're one like me, you'll have already understood.
